# Polysqueeze

Polysqueeze is a Rust SDK for interacting with Polymarket's CLOB (trading), Gamma
(market data), and WebSocket APIs. If you hit auth edge-cases (401s, signature
mismatches, etc.), please open an issue with repro details.



## Highlights

- Fully working REST helpers for the Gamma and CLOB APIs (markets, fills, single orders,
  authentication, helper types).
- Order creation flows have live regression coverage for the single-order path;
  batch/multi-order flows still need more testing and contributions are welcome.
- Gamma data types for markets, tokens, order books, rewards, etc.
- WebSocket helpers for public market events and authenticated user events (see `examples/wss_*.rs`).
- Configuration helpers for Polygon mainnet (137) and testnet (80002), plus shared utils for signing, math, and fills.

## Quickstart

1. Add `polysqueeze` to your deps:
```bash
cargo add polysqueeze
```

2. Create a client, derive API keys, and post a sample order. This is the one path
   that currently runs against the live API (single-order placement); batch order
   flows and broader WebSocket handling still need more testing and are open for
   contributions.

```rust
use polysqueeze::{types::GammaListParams, ClobClient, OrderArgs, OrderType, Side};
use rust_decimal::Decimal;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> polysqueeze::Result<()> {
    let base_url = "https://clob.polymarket.com";
    let private_key = std::env::var("POLY_PRIVATE_KEY")?;

    let l1_client = ClobClient::with_l1_headers(base_url, &private_key, 137);
    let creds = l1_client.create_or_derive_api_key(None).await?;

    let mut client = ClobClient::with_l2_headers(base_url, &private_key, 137, creds.clone());

    // Filter markets with various criteria
    let gamma_params = GammaListParams {
        limit: Some(10),
        closed: Some(false),                  // Exclude closed markets
        liquidity_num_min: Some(Decimal::from(1000)),  // Min liquidity
        liquidity_num_max: Some(Decimal::from(1000000)), // Max liquidity
        volume_num_min: Some(Decimal::from(10000)),    // Min volume
        cyom: Some(false),                    // Exclude create-your-own markets
        include_tag: Some(true),              // Include tag data
        ..Default::default()
    };
    let market_data = client.get_markets(None, Some(&gamma_params)).await?;
    println!("{} markets fetched", market_data.data.len());

    // Replace with a real CLOB token id (see `market_data` or use `.env.example` + examples).
    let token_id = "token-id-here";
    let order_args = OrderArgs::new(
        token_id,
        Decimal::new(5000, 4),
        Decimal::new(1, 0),
        Side::BUY,
    );

    let signed_order = client.create_order(&order_args, None, None, None).await?;
    client.post_order(signed_order, OrderType::GTC).await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

3. For WebSockets, start with the typed `wss::{WssMarketClient, WssUserClient}` helpers (see
   `examples/wss_market.rs` and `examples/wss_user.rs`). For lower-level streaming primitives,
   see the `ws` module.

## Examples

- `examples/order.rs`: derive an API key and place a tiny order (opt-in).
- `examples/wss_market.rs`: subscribe to public market channel events.
- `examples/wss_user.rs`: authenticated user channel (orders/trades) events.
- `examples/wss_cancel.rs`: cancel an order by ID.
- `examples/new_with_auth.rs`: create a client using auth helpers.
- `examples/balance_allowance.rs`: inspect balances/allowances.

The smoke-testing logic from `tests/place_order.rs` is also available as `examples/order.rs`. To run it locally:

```bash
cargo run --example order
```

It expects the same environment variables as the test (private key, API creds,
network, etc.) and drops a microscopic order when `RUN_PLACE_ORDER_TEST=1` is set.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your wallet key plus any overrides
(`POLY_CHAIN_ID`, `POLY_API_URL`, `POLY_FUNDER`, `POLY_TEST_TOKEN`). Only the
private key is strictly required; the rest are optional fallbacks.

`examples/wss_market.rs` shows how to consume the public MARKET channel for
price/book updates. Set `POLY_WSS_MARKETS` and/or `POLY_WSS_ASSET_IDS` to the
condition/asset IDs you care about, then run:

```bash
cargo run --example wss_market
```

The example prints `book`, `price_change`, `tick_size_change`, and
`last_trade_price` events for the subscribed markets.

For authenticated events, `examples/wss_user.rs` shows how to derive an API key,
construct `WssUserClient`, and stream `WssUserEvent::Order`/`Trade` messages.
Run it via `cargo run --example wss_user` once `POLY_PRIVATE_KEY` is set. It
places a tiny limit order on a ≥1M-liquidity market (you can tweak
`POLY_WSS_MIN_LIQUIDITY`) and prints the resulting order ID, then waits for user
events so you can observe partial fills/cancellations. While that example
runs, start `POLY_WSS_ORDER_ID=… cargo run --example wss_cancel` from another
terminal to cancel the order and trigger a `WssUserEvent::Order` update.

If you already have API credentials, `WssUserClient` exposes the authenticated
user channel so you can react to your own orders and trades. Construct
`WssUserClient::new(api_creds.api_key.clone())`, subscribe to the markets you're
trading, and drive `next_event()` to consume `WssUserEvent::Order` and
`WssUserEvent::Trade` payloads that mirror the data shown above.

## Gamma and Data APIs

Use the `client` module to call Gamma endpoints such as `/markets`, `/events`,
`/tags`, and `NegRisk` data. Only the Gamma markets and single-order creation
paths have live regression coverage today; feel free to extend coverage to more
endpoints or submit fixes. The `types` module contains strongly typed responses
such as `Market`, `MarketOrderArgs`, and `OrderBookSummary`.

### GammaListParams Reference

The following parameters are available for filtering markets when calling
`ClobClient::get_markets()`:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `limit` | `Option<i32>` | Maximum number of markets to return |
| `closed` | `Option<bool>` | Include or exclude closed markets |
| `liquidity_num_min` | `Option<Decimal>` | Minimum liquidity threshold |
| `liquidity_num_max` | `Option<Decimal>` | Maximum liquidity threshold |
| `volume_num_min` | `Option<Decimal>` | Minimum trading volume threshold |
| `volume_num_max` | `Option<Decimal>` | Maximum trading volume threshold |
| `cyom` | `Option<bool>` | Include create-your-own markets (CYOM) |
| `include_tag` | `Option<bool>` | Include tag metadata in response |
| `tag` | `Option<String>` | Filter by specific tag |
| `related` | `Option<bool>` | Include related markets |
| `archived` | `Option<bool>` | Include archived markets |
| `order_by` | `Option<String>` | Sort field (e.g., "volume", "liquidity", "created_date") |
| `order_dir` | `Option<String>` | Sort direction ("asc" or "desc") |
| `currency` | `Option<String>` | Currency for pricing (default: "USD") |
| `maker_fee` | `Option<f64>` | Maker fee filter |
| `taker_fee` | `Option<f64>` | Taker fee filter |
| `pfm` | `Option<bool>` | Profit/fee mode |
| `search` | `Option<String>` | Free text search across markets |

### Using GammaClient

For market, event, and tag queries, use the dedicated GammaClient:

```rust
use polysqueeze::api::GammaClient;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let gamma_client = GammaClient::new();
    
    // Fetch markets
    let markets = gamma_client.get_markets(None, None).await?;
    println!("Markets: {:?}", markets);
    
    // Fetch events
    let events = gamma_client.get_events(None).await?;
    println!("Events: {:?}", events);
    
    // Fetch tags
    let tags = gamma_client.get_tags().await?;
    println!("Tags: {:?}", tags);
    
    Ok(())
}
```

## Testing

Test order placement with this command (make sure env variables are set). This
exercise is what we currently rely on as basic coverage for the order APIs:
```bash
# WARNING: this test places a small real order on Polymarket
RUN_PLACE_ORDER_TEST=1 cargo test place_order -- --nocapture
```

Other live tests are opt-in as well:
- `RUN_AUTH_TEST=1` (auth derivation/verification)
- `RUN_GAMMA_TESTS=1` (Gamma live endpoints / `ClobClient::get_markets`)
- `RUN_DATA_API_TESTS=1` (data-api `/value` + `/positions`)
